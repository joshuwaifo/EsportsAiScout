Perfect. I’ll gather everything you need to rebrand and refocus EsportsAiScout around the Street Fighter Series for the AICHI NAGOYA ASIAN GAMES. I’ll identify core gameplay dynamics, scouting and strategy opportunities, relevant stats to track, available data sources, and visuals or assets you can use to enhance the app experience. This will be a solid foundation for expanding to other titles later.

# Street Fighter Esports & Asian Games Overview

**Street Fighter** is a legendary fighting game series that has become a staple in esports worldwide. Notably, it has been included as a medal event in multi-sport competitions like the Asian Games. In the *Hangzhou 2022 (held in 2023)* Asian Games, **Street Fighter V: Champion Edition** was one of the titles, contested in a 1v1 format. The competition featured national representatives (each country fielding up to two players) fighting through a bracket to claim medals ([Street Fighter V at Asian Games 2023: Know schedule, teams and format - watch live in India - Sportsadda](https://sportsadda.com/esports/news/asian-games-2023-street-fighter-v-schedule-dates-teams-telecast-watch-live-streaming-india/#:~:text=Asian%20Games%202023%20Street%20Fighter,V%20teams%20and%20rosters)) ([Street Fighter V at Asian Games 2023: Know schedule, teams and format - watch live in India - Sportsadda](https://sportsadda.com/esports/news/asian-games-2023-street-fighter-v-schedule-dates-teams-telecast-watch-live-streaming-india/#:~:text=Asian%20Games%202023%20Street%20Fighter,V%20format)). Looking ahead to *Aichi-Nagoya 2026*, the Asian Games will include the **Street Fighter series** again, now under a *“Competitive Martial Arts (Team Competition)”* category. This suggests Street Fighter 6 will be played, possibly alongside other fighting games (Tekken, King of Fighters) contributing to an overall team medal in that category. Whether as an individual event or part of a team format, Street Fighter’s inclusion in such a prestigious event underscores its structured competitive format and global appeal.

## Street Fighter Competitive Format

In professional play and international events, Street Fighter matches are typically **one-on-one** bouts in a **best-of-three** rounds per match format (often called *first-to-2* in fighting game terms). Tournament sets are usually **best-of-3 games** (first to 2 game wins) in earlier rounds, and sometimes best-of-5 in later stages for finals. For example, at the Hangzhou Asian Games Street Fighter V tournament, matches were best-of-three and the bracket was **double-elimination** (players drop to a loser’s bracket after one loss, and are eliminated after a second loss) ([Street Fighter V at Asian Games 2023: Know schedule, teams and format - watch live in India - Sportsadda](https://sportsadda.com/esports/news/asian-games-2023-street-fighter-v-schedule-dates-teams-telecast-watch-live-streaming-india/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20format%2C%20the,advance%20to%20the%20main%20bracket)). One quirk at that event was that the Grand Final was handled as a single match without a bracket reset ([Street Fighter V at Asian Games 2023: Know schedule, teams and format - watch live in India - Sportsadda](https://sportsadda.com/esports/news/asian-games-2023-street-fighter-v-schedule-dates-teams-telecast-watch-live-streaming-india/#:~:text=than%2032%20players,advance%20to%20the%20main%20bracket)), likely due to scheduling – but generally, in open tournaments like Evo or Capcom Cup, the Grand Final allows the loser’s bracket finalist to reset the bracket with an initial win (since double-elimination means the winner’s finalist hasn’t lost yet). We can expect Street Fighter 6 at the Asian Games to follow a similar structure: players competing in **1v1 duels**, progressing through group stages or qualifiers into a **double-elimination playoff bracket**, with each match decided in a best-of-3 series until a champion is crowned.

It’s important to note that the “Competitive Martial Arts” team format in 2026 might integrate Street Fighter results with other games. This could mean each country’s esports team has members playing **Street Fighter 6, Tekken 7/8, King of Fighters** etc., and their combined performance yields one set of medals. This is somewhat analogous to a team athletics event: each game could be like a “leg” of the competition. However, the exact format (whether cumulative points or relay-style matchups) has not been fully detailed yet. Regardless, **Street Fighter’s competitive rules** – rounds, match length, and bracket style – will remain consistent within its portion. Typically, a Street Fighter match consists of two players selecting characters, then engaging in a best-of-3 **rounds** fight. Rounds are time-limited (e.g. 99 seconds) and use the game’s health system: deplete the opponent’s life bar to win a round, win two rounds to win the game. High-level tournaments usually enforce standard settings and the latest patch of the game (Street Fighter 6 in 2026). 

**Summary of Format:** For integration into an AI scouting tool, we can assume Street Fighter events use **1v1 matches** in a **tournament bracket**. The scouting app should be designed to handle **match results (wins/losses)** and possibly bracket information (who advances, from winners or losers side). Understanding the format allows the AI to contextualize performance: e.g., differentiating pool stage best-of-3s from grand finals, or recognizing when a player made a losers bracket run (indicating adaptation and stamina).

## Key Strategic Elements & Player Behaviors in Street Fighter

Street Fighter is often described as a deep strategic battle of wits, reflexes, and adaptation. Some key competitive elements include:

- **Footsies and Spacing:** Players jockey for position just outside each other’s attack range, trying to make the opponent whiff an attack and then punish it. This spacing game, known as *footsies*, is fundamental. A great player will control space with quick *pokes* and know exactly when to strike or block. They also use movement (walking, dashing) to bait attacks.

- **Reaction and Anti-airs:** Jumping is a risky but rewarding maneuver – it can bypass ground attacks but leaves one vulnerable. Strong players have sharp **reaction time** to anti-air jump-ins reliably (using an uppercut or appropriate normal move). For instance, a common advice to newer players is to practice anti-airs, because failing to counter jump attacks can cost you the match ([Raging Download. Fighting Game Data Analytics | by TyE | Medium](https://medium.com/@TyEdwardz/raging-download-a3ff6fcc42cb#:~:text=during%20the%20match%2C%20they%20can,in%20fighting%20games%20can%20extremely)). An AI could track how often a player successfully anti-airs versus how often they get hit by jump-ins as a metric of defensive skill.

- **Combos and Execution:** Street Fighter rewards executing predefined sequences of attacks (*combos*) to maximize damage from an opening. Top players have excellent **execution skill**, meaning they rarely drop (fail) their combos under pressure. They choose optimal combos for the situation (for damage, or for positioning). The scouting tool can log combo success rates, average combo damage, and dropped opportunities.

- **Resource Management:** Modern Street Fighter games have multiple meters/resources. In Street Fighter V it was the EX Gauge and V-Gauge; in Street Fighter 6, there’s the **Drive Gauge** and Super Art meter. Good players manage these resources wisely – e.g., knowing when to use EX moves or supers for extra damage, and in SF6, how to use the Drive Gauge for **Drive Impacts, Drive Parries, or Drive Rush** without running into burnout. Mismanaging resources (like going into **Burnout** in SF6, which leaves one at severe disadvantage) can lose rounds. The scouting AI could monitor when players tend to enter low-resource states or how effectively they use meter (e.g., do they often end rounds with full meter – which might indicate missed opportunities to use a Critical Art super).

- **Adaptation and Mind Games:** Perhaps the most celebrated skill in fighting games is **adaptation** – the ability to adjust one’s strategy based on the opponent’s tendencies. The FGC (Fighting Game Community) often speaks of *“downloading”* the opponent’s game plan. This refers to recognizing patterns: Does the opponent jump frequently? Do they wake-up with a risky uppercut when under pressure? How do they react to fireballs? Top Street Fighter players will identify these habits within a few rounds and counter them. *“Download complete”* means you’ve figured out the opponent’s style. Key behaviors to track for adaptation include how a player’s strategy shifts from Round 1 to Round 3, or between matches in a set. An AI could model this by noting if a player, for example, blocks more often against an opponent known for reversals (*invincible “Dragon Punch” moves*) as the set goes on, or starts punishing a certain repeated move.

- **Mix-ups and Defense:** Street Fighter is also about **mix-ups** – forcing the opponent into a guessing situation (high/low attack, throw or strike, etc.). Good players have “unreactable” mix-ups and can condition opponents to expect one thing and do another. Conversely, strong **defense** means not falling for the same trick repeatedly: e.g., teching throws, blocking cross-ups correctly, and not cracking under pressure. AI could track metrics like throw-tech success rate, or how often a player gets opened up by, say, an overhead attack.

- **Character Match-up Knowledge:** Each character in Street Fighter has unique moves and weaknesses. Competitive players study **match-up charts** that rate how character A fares vs character B. Knowing the match-up means knowing the opponent’s options. For instance, if facing **Guile** (who has strong projectiles), a knowledgeable player knows they must be patient or have ways around fireballs. The Asian Games will likely allow a roster of characters, so part of strategy is also **character selection and counter-picking** in some formats (though often players stick to their mains in a single elimination bracket). The scouting tool can incorporate **match-up data** – e.g., if a player struggles against a certain character historically, the AI can flag that.

In essence, **what makes a great Street Fighter player** is a combination of solid fundamentals (footsies, spacing, execution), game knowledge, and adaptive mind games. A good scouting system should therefore observe *how* a player wins: Do they overwhelm opponents with aggression? Do they play reactive and punish mistakes? Do they have any habits that a clever opponent could exploit?

## Data Available from Street Fighter Matches

One advantage for an AI scout is that fighting games are played on digital platforms that can produce detailed match telemetry. **Street Fighter matches generate a rich sequence of events**: every input and action (every punch, kick, fireball, jump, block, etc.) and the outcome (hit, block, counter-hit, damage dealt). Modern titles like SFV and SF6 often have replay features and sometimes even built-in stats. For example, *Street Fighter V* provided lifetime player statistics (like total wins, characters used, etc.), though those were cumulative and not broken down by match. 

Important types of data we can get or derive from matches include:

- **Character selections:** Which characters each player chose (and possibly which costume or V-Skill/V-Trigger in SFV, or which preset in SF6). This is trivial to record from match logs or brackets.

- **Win/Loss and Round Outcomes:** For each match, who won and lost, and possibly the round-by-round results (e.g., 2–1 round count). We can also log how decisive rounds were (e.g., did a player win with a perfect round or a clutch pixel health comeback).

- **Chronological Event Data:** The timeline of moves and actions. If we record a match at the level of each move, we could list sequences like “Player1 at 90s: throws fireball, Player2 blocks; 88s: Player2 jumps, Player1 anti-airs with crouching heavy punch (hits); etc.” This kind of **frame-by-frame log** was demonstrated by an analysis on Kaggle where a set of matches between pro players Daigo and Tokido was manually logged for every action. From such data, one can compute derived stats.

- **Damage and Combo Data:** How much damage each combo or hit did, who landed the biggest combos, average combo length, etc. For instance, by analyzing the Daigo vs Tokido dataset, the author was able to calculate the total damage Tokido took from Daigo’s projectiles across all rounds. We could similarly calculate metrics like *average damage per opening* (how effective a player is when they land a hit).

- **Move usage frequency:** Counting how many times each move or action was used. In the mentioned analysis, it was found that Daigo (playing Guile) threw **464 Sonic Booms** over 12 matches, and an overwhelming majority of those projectiles either forced the opponent to block or got a hit/trade (only 8 were cleanly nullified). This kind of data highlights a player’s style (heavy projectile usage in this case) and effectiveness. Similarly, we can log how often a player jumps, dashes, uses EX moves, etc.

- **Success rates of actions:** It’s not just frequency; we care about outcomes. For example, out of X jump-in attempts by a player, how many resulted in a hit versus how many got anti-aired. In the Daigo-Tokido study, both players jumped about the same number of times, but over 50% of Daigo’s jumps resulted in a successful hit or blocked attack, whereas Tokido’s jumps mostly failed (he got hit out of the air often). This reveals that **Tokido’s anti-air game was insufficient**, and/or Daigo timed his jumps well. An AI scout can extract such stats for any match: *jump-in success rate*, *anti-air accuracy*, *throw tech success*, *reversal success rate* (how often an invincible wake-up move connects or gets blocked), etc.

- **Frame Data and Reaction Metrics:** We could dive deeper and look at the frame-by-frame situation. For example, measuring **reaction time** – if a player blocks an overhead that is reactable at, say, 20 frames, did they block it on time or always get hit? Or how quickly do they punish a blocked move (if the opponent did an unsafe move that is -10 on block, did our player respond within that 10-frame window with a punish combo, or let them get away)? These require detailed log or even hooking into the game’s frame data. Some community data sources (like FAT – Frame Assistant Tool) provide frame data for all moves; combining that with match logs can let us calculate whether an action was a true punish or not.

- **Round-by-round performance metrics:** e.g., remaining health at round end (dominance), time taken to win a round (fast aggressive win vs slow timeout strategy), clutch metrics like come-backs (won after being at low health), etc.

- **Psychological/Behavioral metrics:** These are trickier to quantify but we can approximate. For example, “tendency to use reversal Dragon Punch on wake-up” – the AI can count how often a player did an invincible move immediately after being knocked down. Or “tendency to throw on opponent’s wake-up” for offensive style. Over many matches, these stats paint a picture of a player’s habits.

**Data availability:** Modern Street Fighter games often have online platforms (like Capcom’s **Fighter ID / CFN – Capcom Fighters Network** for SF5/SF6) where some data can be accessed. However, **Capcom does not provide an open public API** for pulling detailed match data in bulk. According to community discussions, the only way to get CFN stats is by web-scraping their site (sometimes called “the Shadaloo CRI/Buckler site”). Indeed, fans have built unofficial tools – for SFV there were community APIs and Discord bots for stats, and for SF6, there are scraping scripts (e.g., an Apify Street Fighter 6 CFN scraper). 

For the EsportsAiScout tool, likely data will come from a combination of sources:
- **Tournament Platforms**: Websites like **start.gg** (formerly Smash.gg) or **Challonge** host tournament brackets and sometimes allow API access to match results. We can get who faced whom, scores, etc., for events like Capcom Pro Tour or local tournaments if they’re run on these platforms.
- **Official feeds/APIs**: If the Asian Games or AESF provides an API or data feed for match results, that could be tapped. If not, scraping their results pages or using public info might be needed.
- **Capcom Pro Tour Data**: The Capcom Pro Tour site and Liquipedia have rich archives of results for Street Fighter tournaments. While they might not give per-round data, they list match outcomes in major events. Liquipedia’s Fighting Games Wiki often has the characters used and scoreline for top 8 matches, which the scout tool could parse to enrich player profiles (e.g., “Player X beat Player Y 2-1 using Chun-Li vs Ryu at Evo 2024”).
- **Player Replays and YouTube**: A lot of match footage is on YouTube/Twitch (including Asian Games matches, Evo, etc.). While video analysis is more complex (involving computer vision or manual tagging), it’s a goldmine for historical data. An AI could theoretically watch a video and reconstruct the timeline of moves (though that’s a challenging task). Alternatively, if players share replay files or if CFN replay IDs can be fetched, the tool could get data from there.
- **Community Data (Fightcade logs)**: *Fightcade* is a platform for playing retro fighting games online (like Street Fighter II, III). It might not directly apply to SF6, but for the “Street Fighter series” broadly, if one wanted to include analysis of classic titles or player practice sessions on Fightcade, it’s possible to parse fightcade replay logs. Fightcade replays can be saved and are essentially sequences of inputs for emulator playback, which an AI could interpret. However, for our scope (Street Fighter esports, focusing on current title), Fightcade is less relevant except for players who also compete in retro game tournaments.

- **Kaggle Datasets & Community Stats**: As referenced, some enthusiasts upload match data to Kaggle or share stats in Reddit threads. These can provide sample data to train or test the scouting analytics. For example, the *Daigo vs Tokido* dataset can be used to prototype analysis scripts (how to calculate action frequencies, etc.), and a *Street Fighter 6 Ranked Matches* dataset might exist for general online play patterns.

In summary, **the scouting tool will have access to**: basic match results from tournament brackets, detailed per-match event data if we gather it (through replays or scraping), and metadata like characters and stages. We should plan features in our React dashboard to ingest and display these data types (win rates, move usage stats, etc.).

## Scouting Metrics for Player Evaluation

To convince coaches and judges of the value of EsportsAiScout tailored to Street Fighter, we need to demonstrate meaningful **player performance metrics** the AI can track and analyze. Here are key scouting metrics and how the AI can evaluate them:

- **Win Rate and Tournament Placements:** Baseline stats like a player’s win-loss record, their average placement in tournaments, and head-to-head records. The AI can aggregate how often a player beats high-ranked opponents or their track record in international events (e.g., did they go 0-2 or reach top 8 consistently).

- **Adaptability Score:** A measure of how well a player adapts during a set. For example, if a player loses the first round but wins the next two, or loses one game and then reverses 3-0 in a best-of-5, it shows adaptation. We can quantify things like **round win percentage after a loss** or improvement in performance over time. If we have access to long sets, the AI could see if the player downloads opponents – e.g., do their **hit rates** improve in later rounds? One could literally chart the change in strategy: maybe using less of a certain move once it’s countered. These things can be turned into an “Adaptation Index.”

- **Offensive vs Defensive Balance:** Metrics like **average damage dealt per round** vs **damage taken per round**, and time to victory. An aggressive player might end rounds quickly with high damage bursts, whereas a defensive player might win by timeout or small leads. Neither is “better” inherently, but scouting can identify a player’s style. The tool can label players as Aggressive, Balanced, or Defensive based on stats (like average remaining time when they win a round, or how often they perfect an opponent vs how often they win by timeout).

- **Execution and Combo Efficiency:** The AI can track how many combo opportunities were converted. For instance, if a player lands a jump-in (which is a big chance) – did they maximize it with a high-damage combo or drop it? A *combo success rate* can be logged (e.g., *Player landed 15 clean hits in the match and attempted 10 big combos, of which 8 were successful, 2 dropped*). Also measure *average combo damage*. A top player might average higher damage per opening than a lesser player, indicating better optimization. Execution can also be tested in terms of difficult techniques (like one-frame links in SFV or perfect parries in SF6) – how often does the player successfully perform these?

- **Defensive Awareness:** Metrics such as **anti-air success rate** – e.g., “Player X successfully anti-aired 70% of jump-ins, which is above the pro average of ~50%.” Also **throw tech rate** (how often they break opponent throws), **blocking success** (how often do they correctly block high/low mix-ups). We can even track *reversal usage*: does the player bet on invincible dragon punches often, and what’s the success? If a player does wake-up DP 10 times and only 2 hit while 8 got blocked (and presumably punished), that’s a risky pattern – the AI can flag that as a habit to exploit.

- **Resource Utilization:** An interesting metric could be **meter waste vs usage**. For example, ending a round with full super meter (when you died without using it) could be considered a misplay – the AI might note “this player frequently doesn’t use their Super meter before losing.” In SF6, if a player frequently goes into Burnout (depleting their Drive Gauge) and then loses rounds, it indicates poor drive management. Conversely, a player who smartly stays out of burnout and uses Drive Impact at opportune moments could get a high “Resource Management” score. The scouting app could show something like: *Drive Gauge utilization: 80% (spent gauge that contributed to offense or defense effectively) vs wasted 20% (regenerated unused or got burned out).* 

- **Character Mastery and Versatility:** The AI can look at how many characters a player uses successfully. Some players are character specialists, others have multiple picks. If the tool knows a player’s win rates by character, it can advise if their secondary character might statistically be a better pick in a certain matchup. Also, within one character, metrics like **breadth of move usage** – do they use all the tools the character has or rely on a few? In the earlier example, Tokido under-used a specific move (Urien’s V-Skill 1) that could counter fireballs. An AI spotting that could say “Player is not utilizing Tool X of their character, which could be a gap in their game.”

- **Clutch Factor:** Some players perform under pressure exceptionally well. Metrics for this could be *win rate in final rounds* (e.g., in a 1–1 tied game, who takes the deciding round?), or comebacks (won a round after being below 10% health). We could call this “Clutch Win %”. If a player has a high clutch win rate, they’re mentally strong and can’t be easily counted out. Conversely, a player who often loses deciders might have nerves issues – something a coach would want to know.

- **Consistency vs Streakiness:** Does the player play at a steady level or swing dramatically? The AI can track performance across many matches. A very erratic metric might suggest inconsistency. Consistency could be measured by how often they beat players of lower skill versus upset players of higher skill. A consistent top player will rarely lose to unknowns. If our scouting tool integrates global ranking or player ELO, it can identify upsets.

All these metrics give a **holistic picture** of a Street Fighter player. For example, the tool might produce a radar/spider chart of a player: *Offense (9/10), Defense (6/10), Execution (8/10), Adaptation (7/10), Matchup Knowledge (9/10)* based on the data fed. This helps compare players. Judges and coaches can see quantifiable evidence of why Player A is stronger or weaker than Player B in certain aspects. For instance, “Player A anti-airs 20% more effectively than the field average, which suggests he’s very hard to jump in on – opponents might avoid aerial approaches against him.” Or, “Player B tends to crack when low on life – his comeback win rate is only 5%, indicating a possible psychological weakness in clutch situations.”

## In-Match Strategy Guidance Opportunities

Beyond post-match analysis, an AI scout could also assist **during matches or between rounds** with strategy insights (subject to competition rules on coaching). Some potential in-match (or live) guidance features:

- **Real-time Tendency Warnings:** The AI, having studied both competitors, could issue live alerts like: *“Opponent has meter and likes wake-up super: be cautious on their wake-up now.”* For example, if data shows the opponent has done an invincible reversal in 4 out of 5 knockdown situations, the AI can predict a high chance of it happening again. A coach or the player (if allowed) seeing this could decide to bait and punish that tendency.

- **Matchup-specific Tips:** The app can have a knowledge base of matchup advice. If it detects, say, *Chun-Li vs Zangief* matchup is being played, it could highlight key points (e.g., “Chun-Li should keep Zangief at mid-range with pokes and avoid being cornered. Zangief will look for jump or sweep to get in – watch out for his spinning piledriver if he’s close.”). This can be presented between rounds in a quick summary. Essentially, it’s like having instant access to matchup notes that players usually have to study beforehand.

- **Optimal Punish Suggestions:** If the AI is parsing the match in real time (possibly via direct game integration or a capture feed), it could recognize moves that were unsafe or opportunities missed. For instance, if the opponent does a very unsafe move and our player only did a light punish, the AI might suggest “Next time, punish that with your max damage combo (e.g., Crush Counter combo or raw super) for better outcome.” Over time, the player learns the ideal punish choices. This is like having an ever-watchful coach who never misses a detail.

- **Resource Alerts:** The AI can remind about resources: *“You have full meter – consider using a Critical Art for chip kill or to extend your lead.”* Or conversely, *“Opponent in Burnout – now is the time to pressure!”* These strategic reminders ensure players capitalize on the game state. In Street Fighter 6, when the opponent is in Burnout (no Drive gauge), they cannot perform invincible EX reversals or Drive options and will get stunned if pressured too much – the AI should yell (figuratively) at the player to go on the offensive in those moments.

- **Emotional/Tempo hints:** While harder to quantify, the AI could notice if a player has, say, lost two rounds in a row quickly (maybe they are flustered). It might recommend taking a breather – some tournaments allow a short break or character select screen delay to regain composure. The app might flash a “Slow down and refocus” tip if it senses deteriorating performance. This is speculative, but tying data to psychology (like noticing execution errors piling up) could hint the player is nervous.

For the Asian Games context, direct coaching mid-game might be limited, but between matches or during training sessions these insights are invaluable. The AI essentially becomes a **virtual coach**, using data to suggest adaptations that a human might otherwise miss in the heat of competition. Judges evaluating our tool will see that it's not just crunching numbers; it’s actively informing strategy to improve outcomes.

## Example Features for EsportsAiScout (Street Fighter Module)

To integrate all the above into a **React-based scouting dashboard**, here are concrete features and how they’d appear:

- **Player Dashboard with Stats:** A profile page for each player with their **win rates, character usage, and performance metrics**. For example, “<Player Name> – Main: Ryu (80% usage, 65% win rate), Secondary: Ken (20% usage, 55% win rate). Overall win rate 62%. Average tournament placement: 5th.” It can show recent matches and outcomes. It would also display the scouting metrics discussed: perhaps a bar graph or radar chart comparing the player’s stats to the tournament average or to a top player. Judges can quickly see a visualization of, say, **combo success rate** or **attack patterns** for that player.

- **Match Replay Analysis Tool:** The app could allow users to input a match (via a replay file or manual input of moves) and then output an analysis. For example, if we input the grand finals match of a tournament, the tool could produce a timeline with key events: “Round 1: Player A landed 3 jump-ins (opponent failed to anti-air) and won. Round 2: Player B adapted, 0 jump-ins succeeded, and Player B won with a life lead. Round 3: Player A used super meter at 0:20 to secure a kill,” etc. It might also generate charts like those in data-analysis articles – e.g., a pie chart of how Player A’s jump attempts resulted (hit/block vs getting anti-aired), or a bar graph of damage sources (how much damage came from throws, from special moves, from combos, etc.). Such visual breakdowns make it easy to identify a player’s strengths/weaknesses. For instance, a chart might show Player A got 60% of their damage from fireballs – indicating a very zoning-heavy strategy.

- **Live Match Tracker:** During an ongoing match (perhaps for coaches or analysts), the app can display live stats. Imagine a small panel updating in real time: “Throws: Player A 2/5 landed, Player B 0/2; Anti-airs: Player A 3/4, Player B 1/6; Current longest combo: 4 hits by Player A for 250 damage,” etc. This is similar to live sports analytics (like how basketball broadcasts show stats mid-game). It enhances viewing and can also feed commentary. Even if not used directly by the competitors, commentators or analysts could use the tool to highlight interesting stats (“Notice how Player B has not landed a single jump attack because Player A’s anti-airs are on point – 75% success rate so far!”).

- **Matchup Explorer:** A feature where you select two characters and the app shows known matchup info and historical data. For example, select *Chun-Li vs Marisa (SF6)* – the tool might show the overall online win rate for that matchup (if data scraped from CFN or community sources), any notes from pro matchup charts (like “Chun-Li 5.5 : 4.5 Marisa” meaning slight advantage Chun), and tips: “Chun should keep Marisa at range with low pokes; watch out for Marisa’s armored moves.” It could also list if our scouted players have faced this matchup – e.g., “Player X’s record as Chun vs Marisa players: 8 wins, 2 losses.” This helps in **pre-match preparation**.

- **Training Recommendations:** After analyzing a player, the AI can produce a training to-do list. E.g., “Focus Practice: Anti-air consistency. You allowed 8 jump-in hits in last 20 rounds, try to reduce this. Drill: set training mode to CPU jump at intervals for DP practice.” Or “Combo optimization: You dropped 3 critical kill-confirm combos in the tournament. Practice executing <specific combo>. Maybe switch to a more reliable combo under pressure for slightly less damage.” This feature makes the tool directly useful for players to improve, not just for scouting opponents.

- **Comparison Tool:** Pick any two players and get a side-by-side stat comparison. This could be useful for coaches deciding who to field in a team match, or for commentators doing a pre-game analysis. For example: *Player A vs Player B:* show their win rates, their head-to-head if they played before, and differences in style (maybe one has higher average aggression, the other better defense). If the app predicts anything (maybe using an ELO rating or a simple algorithm), it could even say “Favored to win: Player A (64% probability based on past data).” This kind of feature, if accurate, really impresses how data-driven scouting can inform expectations.

- **Event Bracket Integration:** The app can display a tournament bracket, and allow clicking on a match to see the detailed breakdown. So for Asian Games, you could see the bracket, click on “Japan vs Korea” match (since at Asian Games it was country vs country effectively), and see the match stats or the players involved. This makes it a one-stop dashboard for both overview and detail.

- **Alerts and Notifications:** If used over a season, the AI could send alerts like “Player X has improved their anti-air rate by 15% in the last month” or “New top combo damage recorded by Player Y in last tournament: 500 damage!”. These keep the scouting insights continuous and show progress or new trends (for example, if after a patch, a player performs even better – maybe due to character buffs – the tool can highlight that).

All these features would be presented in a clean, readable **React UI**, likely with charts (using libraries like D3 or Chart.js for the graphs), tables for stats, and maybe even video embed for replays with an overlay of stats. The **readability and format** is crucial – we’d use clear headings, collapsible sections for detailed stats, and tooltips explaining any technical terms (so a judge unfamiliar with “whiff punish” could hover and see “Definition: Punishing an opponent’s missed attack from max distance”).

By focusing on **Street Fighter-specific insights**, the app shows that it’s not just a generic esports tool but one that understands the nuances of the game. For example, it knows what a *Sonic Boom* or *V-Skill* is, and can contextualize their use. In the earlier analysis, noting Tokido’s sparse use of Urien’s V-Skill 1 was a very game-specific insight – our tool could catch similar things, like “This Ken player hardly uses fireballs, which is unusual for Ken; maybe he prefers close combat.”

## Conclusion: Driving Value with a Tailored Street Fighter AI Scout

In summary, **Street Fighter’s competitive scene** – from its structured tournament format ([Street Fighter V at Asian Games 2023: Know schedule, teams and format - watch live in India - Sportsadda](https://sportsadda.com/esports/news/asian-games-2023-street-fighter-v-schedule-dates-teams-telecast-watch-live-streaming-india/#:~:text=As%20per%20the%20format%2C%20the,advance%20to%20the%20main%20bracket)) to the rich strategic gameplay – provides ample data for an AI-driven scouting and strategy tool. The Aichi Nagoya Asian Games will showcase Street Fighter 6 on a huge stage, and a tool like EsportsAiScout can add value by breaking down matches and players in ways that even expert coaches would find insightful. We’ve outlined how the tool can track everything from **basic stats** like win rates to deep **behavioral patterns** like adaptation and move usage tendencies, all derived from match data. We’ve also identified various **data sources** – tournament APIs, community scrapers, and video analysis – to feed the system with reliable information.

By focusing on **what makes Street Fighter unique** (one-on-one mind games, diverse characters, resource management, etc.) and providing actionable insights (be it scouting reports or live tips), the AI scout can greatly enhance training and competition. For judges evaluating our project, the key takeaways are: this system can model a complex esports title in a meaningful way, it can help **identify what elevates a player** (e.g. high anti-air success, smart meter use) and what their vulnerabilities are, and it can present this information in a clear, tailored interface. Essentially, we are translating the intuition and expertise of a fighting game coach into data-driven visuals and recommendations. 

Armed with these insights, **players and coaches can make informed decisions** – whether that’s picking the right character for a matchup, focusing practice on a weak area, or adjusting strategy mid-tournament. And for an event like the Asian Games, where every match is high stakes, having that extra layer of analytics could be the edge that turns a bronze finish into a gold medal victory.
