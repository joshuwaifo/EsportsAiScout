Great! I’ll put together control input combinations, execution tips, and visual aids (diagrams, videos, and step-by-step explanations) for key moves in Street Fighter 6. I’ll also research ways to implement team scouting functionality for 5v5 play — analyzing strengths, weaknesses, matchup suggestions, and optimized play order.

I’ll let you know once everything is ready for you to review and start integrating into your Replit app.

# Improving the Street Fighter 6 Replit App: Move Input Guide & Team Battle Scouting

## Special Move Input Guide System

**Overview:** A dedicated section of the app will teach and display how to perform key special moves in Street Fighter 6. For example, Ryu's **Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku** (Hurricane Kick) is performed with a *quarter-circle backward* motion on the controller (down → down-back → back) followed by any Kick button, causing Ryu to spin forward with a series of roundhouse kicks ([Moves List: All Special Moves and Super Arts - Street Fighter 6 Guide - IGN](https://www.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-6/Moves_List:_All_Special_Moves_and_Super_Arts#:~:text=Tatsumaki%20Senpu,roundhouse%20kicks%20performed%20while%20airborne)). The guide will present this information through multiple modes: visual diagrams of the controls, an embedded video of the move, step-by-step input instructions, and practical execution tips for timing and strategy.

### Visual Input Diagrams

 ([File:Arcade-Stick-Qcb.png — StrategyWiki | Strategy guide and game reference wiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/File:Arcade-Stick-Qcb.png)) *Quarter-circle back joystick motion (down, down-back, back) – the input used for Ryu’s Tatsumaki Senpukyaku ([Tatsumaki | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Tatsumaki#:~:text=The%20practitioner%20jumps%20and%2C%20while,Spark%20%20and%20%20124)).*  

To clearly illustrate special move inputs, the app can display **controller diagrams** or icons showing the exact joystick and button sequence. In the example of the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, a diagram would highlight the stick starting at the **down** position, sweeping through **down-back** to **back**, and then pressing a **Kick** button ([Tatsumaki | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Tatsumaki#:~:text=The%20practitioner%20jumps%20and%2C%20while,Spark%20%20and%20%20124)). These visuals can be small arrow icons or stylized controller images indicating directions and buttons. For instance, the guide might show a series of arrows (↓ ↙ ←) followed by a kick icon (K) to represent the Tatsumaki input. Using such visual cues helps players quickly recognize motions like quarter-circles, **Dragon Punch** Z-motions, charge moves, etc., without relying solely on text. 

*Implementation:* The app could use an image sprite sheet of fighting game inputs or Unicode arrow symbols to render these diagrams. Many community resources (like the Street Fighter Wiki) provide icon sets for joystick directions and buttons ([Category:Command Input Images | Street Fighter Wiki - Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Command_Input_Images#:~:text=Category%3ACommand%20Input%20Images%20,png)). These can be integrated into the web UI (e.g. as `<img>` tags or CSS background images) to show inputs inline with explanatory text. Ensuring the images are clear (or scalable SVGs) will make the diagrams readable on different devices.

### Video Demonstrations

Another effective feature is an **embedded video clip** or animation showing the move in action. For each special move, the app can display a short video (or looping GIF) of the character performing the move so users can see the timing and result. For example, a clip of Ryu performing a Tatsumaki in Street Fighter 6 could play alongside the input diagram. This visual reference lets players connect the input with the on-screen effect (seeing Ryu whirlwind-kick forward). 

To implement this, the app might embed YouTube videos or use game footage. For instance, using a YouTube iframe of a Street Fighter 6 tutorial video at the timestamp of the move is a straightforward approach. There are many community-made videos explaining how to do quarter-circle moves and showcasing them ([How To Execute Quarter Circle Motions in Street Fighter - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H_ZEp8O4sc#:~:text=How%20To%20Execute%20Quarter%20Circle,this%20video%20is%20not)). The app could also host short GIFs for each move (ensuring they are optimized for web). By clicking the video, users can watch the move in real time, which reinforces learning the input. 

*Tip:* If using YouTube, consider the YouTube Data API to search for move-specific clips, or maintain a curated list of video URLs for each move. Ensure the videos are embedded with player controls disabled for a cleaner look, and perhaps loop a 2-3 second clip of the move execution. For example, a loop of the Tatsumaki from start to finish can play repeatedly while the user studies the input diagram.

### Step-by-Step Input Instructions

In addition to visuals, the app will provide a **text breakdown of the inputs** in order. This serves as a written tutorial that players can follow step by step. Using the Tatsumaki as an example, the step-by-step instructions might be:

1. **Down (↓)** – Begin by pressing the joystick or D-pad downward.  
2. **Down-Back (↙)** – Slide the stick to the down-back diagonal position.  
3. **Back (←)** – Continue moving to the back position (a quarter-circle motion from down to back).  
4. **Kick (K)** – Press any Kick button as soon as the stick reaches the back position to execute the move.

These steps correspond to the *“quarter-circle back + Kick”* input. By breaking it down, the user can practice the motion in parts. The app’s text will emphasize doing the motion in a smooth rolling movement rather than discrete cardinal directions, since fighting games interpret a clean ②↙③ input as a continuous quarter-circle ([Tatsumaki | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Tatsumaki#:~:text=The%20practitioner%20jumps%20and%2C%20while,Spark%20%20and%20%20124)). Each step can be accompanied by a small icon (e.g. a down arrow symbol next to step 1, etc.) to reinforce the direction.

For complex moves, additional notes can be included per step. For instance, if a move requires a charge (holding a direction for 2 seconds), the instruction would note “*hold for at least 2 seconds*” in that step. If a move has to be done **in the air** (like an aerial Tatsumaki), the first step might be “Jump forward, then input…”. Organizing these as a numbered list makes it easy to follow in sequence.

### Execution Tips (Timing, Spacing, Strategy)

Beyond just inputting the commands, players benefit from tips on **how to execute the move successfully and when to use it strategically**. This section of the guide provides advice on input timing, common mistakes, and practical uses of the move in matches:

- **Input Timing:** Emphasize that the quarter-circle motion should be fluid. A common mistake is not **completing the motion** fully before pressing the button. For example, if the Kick is pressed too early (before reaching the "back" position), the Tatsumaki won’t come out. Ensuring the stick hits all the required inputs (down → down-back → back) in order is key. You can encourage users to turn on *input display* in SF6’s training mode or replays to check their inputs – this way they can see if they missed a direction or pressed the button too soon ([I can't input even the simplest moves in SF6 online play? : r/StreetFighter](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/15b57by/i_cant_input_even_the_simplest_moves_in_sf6/#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20figure,and%20tell%20you%20what%27s%20up)). Practicing slowly at first and gradually increasing speed can help build muscle memory for the motion.

- **Common Errors:** For beginners, quarter-circle moves might accidentally produce other moves (like a Shoryuken) if the inputs are sloppy. The guide can warn, for instance, “if you get an unexpected Dragon Punch, you likely pressed forward before down-back.” Tips like **“return the stick to neutral after the motion”** or **“avoid pressing other directions during the motion”** can be included to troubleshoot typical input errors. These pointers will help users refine their technique for consistency even under pressure (like online play input delay issues).

- **Spacing & Strategy:** Explain when and why to use the move in a match. Using Tatsumaki as an example, note that it moves Ryu forward and the distance traveled depends on the kick strength used (light kick version travels a short distance, heavy kick version goes much farther) ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=Ryu%20launches%20himself%20forward%20with,on%20hit%2C%20putting%20you%20in)). On hit, Tatsumaki Senpukyaku causes a **hard knockdown**, giving Ryu an opportunity to pursue the opponent as they get up ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=Ryu%20launches%20himself%20forward%20with,on%20hit%2C%20putting%20you%20in)). This makes it useful for closing distance and setting up pressure. However, on block the move can be unsafe, so a tip could be: *“Use Tatsumaki to punish a projectile or when you confirm a combo, but avoid throwing it out randomly at close range or you may be countered on block.”* 

- **Advanced Variations:** Mention any EX or aerial versions if relevant. For instance, the **Overdrive (EX) Tatsumaki** in SF6 spins in place like a multi-hit tornado, and if it connects, it puts the opponent in a juggle state, allowing follow-up attacks – especially in the corner ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=Ryu%20launches%20himself%20forward%20with,on%20hit%2C%20putting%20you%20in)). The guide can highlight this: *“EX Tatsumaki deals multiple hits and leaves the opponent airborne, enabling follow-ups like a Shoryuken in the corner for extra damage.”* Similarly, **Aerial Tatsumaki** (performed during a forward jump) can be explained as a way to alter your jump arc and hit from unexpected angles ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=Aerial%20Tatsumaki%20Senpu,back%20%2B%20Kick)). For example, *“Jump forward and input the Tatsumaki to stall your descent and catch opponents who might try to anti-air too early ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=Aerial%20Tatsumaki%20Senpu,back%20%2B%20Kick)).”* This not only teaches execution but also the mind-game aspect of using the move. Additionally, note if the move can evade attacks: Tatsumaki can sometimes hop over low projectiles – historically it lets Ryu and Ken soar above fireballs like Hadokens ([Tatsumaki | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Tatsumaki#:~:text=moving%20the%20joystick%20or%20D,Spark%20%20and%20%20124)) – which can be a crucial tactic against zoners.

By combining these execution tips, the guide doesn’t just show *how* to do the move, but also *how to use it effectively*. The user learns the input and also gains insight into the move’s purpose in competitive play. This dual approach (mechanics + strategy) makes the feature valuable for both new players learning moves and intermediate players looking to optimize their use.

## Team Battle 5v5 Scouting Feature

**Overview:** The app will include a **Team Battle scouting tool** geared towards Street Fighter 6’s Team Battle mode (up to 5v5 team play). This feature allows a coach or player to input details about two teams of fighters and receive an analysis of team strengths, weaknesses, optimal match order, and a simulated “scouting report” of a head-to-head clash. In Street Fighter 6’s Team Battle mode, local teams of up to five members can face off, either in an *Elimination* format (winner stays on until one side is defeated) or a *Best-of-Series* format (fixed match-ups where each team’s members fight one corresponding opponent) ([Team Battle Mode | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Battle_Mode#:~:text=,teams%20of%20two%20or%20four)). Leveraging this mode, the scouting tool helps plan which player should fight first, who to save as an anchor, and what match-ups to aim for to maximize the team’s chance of victory.

### Team Member Profiles & Input Fields

To analyze teams, the app will provide an input form for each team member’s key information. The user (coach) can enter details such as:

- **Player Name** – The handle or name of the player. This helps in identifying players in the report (e.g. *Alice vs Bob* in match-ups) and can be used to fetch additional data if available (like looking up a player’s stats by name).
- **Character** – The Street Fighter 6 character that player is using. Knowing the character is crucial for matchup analysis, since different characters have inherent advantages or disadvantages against others. The app could offer a dropdown list of SF6 characters for convenience.
- **Skill Level/Rank** – An indicator of the player’s skill. This could be a rank (e.g. *Gold, Platinum, Master* in SF6 online ranking) or a numerical rating. This helps gauge the experience level of players on each team. For example, a team of Master-ranked players would be expected to have an edge over a team of Silver-ranked players. The app might even pull this data from the network – for instance, using Capcom’s **Buckler’s Boot Camp** service which tracks player rankings and stats online ([Buckler's Boot Camp | STREET FIGHTER 6 | CAPCOM](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/en#:~:text=Buckler%27s%20Boot%20Camp%20,other%20data%20from%20the%20game)).
- **Match History/Stats** – Past performance metrics, if available. The user can input recent win-loss records or specific notes like “Player tends to struggle against zoners” or “Has a 70% win rate with Ryu”. This data can feed into the scouting analysis. Optionally, the app could integrate with online data sources to fetch a player’s recent match history or character win rates (e.g. scraping CFN data or using an API).
- **Preferred Position** – (Optional) The user might indicate if a player is best used as an **anchor** or **starter**. Some players perform well under pressure as the last man, whereas others might be momentum starters. This can be a simple checkbox or note.

The interface will allow entering up to 5 players for the Blue Team and 5 for the Red Team (or fewer, if it’s a 3v3 or other team size). Each team entry could be in a table format with columns for Name, Character, Rank, etc., or a series of cards/forms for each player. Once the data is input, the user can click “Analyze Team Matchup” to run the scouting algorithms.

*Data Source Integration:* If the app is connected to the internet (Replit can allow this), it could try to auto-fill some information. For example, entering a **CFN username** could allow the app to fetch that player’s stats from Capcom’s servers. Capcom’s Buckler’s Boot Camp website provides profiles where you can check play data for yourself and even for opponents/friends (with some limitations) ([Buckler's Boot Camp | STREET FIGHTER 6 | CAPCOM](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/en#:~:text=Buckler%27s%20Boot%20Camp%20,other%20data%20from%20the%20game)). Although no official public API is documented, community tools exist – e.g. an Apify scraper for SF6 CFN data ([Street Fighter 6 CFN Scraper - Apify](https://apify.com/3ternal/street-fighter-6-cfn-scraper#:~:text=Street%20Fighter%206%20CFN%20Scraper,of%20players%20in%20each%20rank)) – which the app could utilize to fetch stats like win rates, most-played characters, etc. Another resource is the Toornament API which has support for Street Fighter 6 ([Street Fighter 6 | API v2.0 | Toornament Developer](https://developer.toornament.com/v2/core-concepts/discipline/features/streetfighter6#:~:text=Street%20Fighter%206%20,specifically%20for%20Street%20Fighter%206)), useful if you wanted to import tournament results for players. For the scope here, manual input with smart suggestions (like auto-complete character names or ranks) will suffice, but these data sources can enhance the feature.

### Automated Team Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

Once team data is entered, the app will automatically analyze the **strengths and weaknesses** of each team, both in absolute terms and relative to the opposing team. This analysis might include:

- **Character Composition:** The tool can summarize each team’s character lineup. For example, *“Team Blue is composed of Ryu, Guile, Zangief, Juri, and Cammy – a balanced team with both zoners and rushdown characters. Team Red has Marisa, Zangief, Honda, Lily, and Manon – a team heavy on grapplers and close-range fighters.”* This overview helps identify stylistic strengths (Team Red might excel at high-damage close combat) and weaknesses (they might struggle against strong keep-away fireballs).
- **Team Stats Averages:** Using the skill level inputs, calculate metrics like *average rank* or *total experience*. *“Team Blue’s average rank is Diamond, whereas Team Red’s average rank is Platinum, indicating Blue may have an experience edge.”* If win-rate or other stats were provided, the app could highlight those (e.g. *“Team Red’s players have a collective win rate of 65% on their mains, suggesting strong overall performance.”*).
- **Coverage of Matchups:** Evaluate if each team has counters to common archetypes. Perhaps one team has three grapplers and no projectile characters – that could be a weakness against a team full of strong zoners. The app can flag this: *“Team Red lacks a projectile user, which could make them vulnerable to heavy zoning. Team Blue’s Guile can exploit this with his Sonic Booms.”* Conversely, strengths like *“Team Blue has a variety of playstyles (zoning, grappling, rushdown), making them adaptable against different opponents”* would be noted.
- **Character Tier/Matchup Data:** Optionally, incorporate known matchup or tier list data. For example, if community matchup charts or win-rate data indicate how each character fares against others, the app can identify problematic matchups. Capcom’s own stats (Battle Data charts) show win rates by character at various skill levels ([Battle Diagrams | Buckler's Boot Camp | STREET FIGHTER 6](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/en/stats/dia#:~:text=Battle%20Diagrams%20,league%20of%20Street%20Fighter%206)). Suppose Juri traditionally has an advantage over Zangief; if Team Blue has Juri and Team Red has Zangief, that’s a point in Blue’s favor in that specific pairing. The analysis could list, for each potential character pairing, a quick note like *“Juri has a slight advantage vs Zangief (due to her pokes and mobility)”*. This requires a data table of matchups which could be pre-fed (from community tier lists or sources like EventHubs or DashFight). Even a simple notation of character tiers could be used: *“All Team Blue characters are currently considered A-tier or higher, while Team Red has two characters viewed as B-tier – this might affect their performance if tier trends hold true.”* Keep in mind tiers aren’t absolute, but they give a general sense of character strength.

- **Team Synergy & Redundancy:** The app can point out if a team is overly reliant on one approach. E.g. *“Team Red has two slow grapplers (Zangief, Honda) – opponents with strong defense or projectile games might trouble them. They might overlap in role, meaning the team could be predictable.”* Or, *“Team Blue’s lineup covers a lot of bases: Ryu for balanced play, Guile for defense, Cammy for offense, etc. This versatility is a strength.”* Such insight is useful for a coach to consider adjustments (maybe swap a character if possible, or plan around those weaknesses).

The output of this analysis can be presented in a friendly way, such as a list of **pros and cons for each team**. For example:

- *Team Blue Strengths:* Strong projectile game (Ryu, Guile), diverse character roster, higher average rank.  
- *Team Blue Weaknesses:* Only one grappler (could struggle if facing defensive turtling).  

- *Team Red Strengths:* High damage output (multiple heavy hitters), two grapplers can overwhelm if they get in.  
- *Team Red Weaknesses:* Limited ranged options, somewhat slower team overall.

Such a summary (possibly in bullet points as above) gives a clear picture at a glance. The coach can verify if this matches their intuition, and it might reveal things they hadn’t considered.

### Optimal Play Order Suggestions

A particularly valuable part of the scouting feature is suggesting an **optimal team order** for an elimination-style battle. In SF6’s elimination Team Battle (winner stays format), the order of players can be crucial ([Team Battle Mode | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Battle_Mode#:~:text=,teams%20of%20two%20or%20four)). The app will consider the matchup potentials between every player on Team A and Team B and recommend an order that maximizes favorable matchups.

**How it works:** The tool can simulate a matchup matrix. For each player on Team Blue against each player on Team Red, estimate a win probability or advantage. This could be based on several factors: character matchup (as discussed), player skill level, and any known head-to-head history. For example, if Team Blue’s first member (Alice playing Guile) would likely beat most of Team Red except one (say she struggles against the Red team’s Juri player), the app notes that. It then tries to arrange the order so that Alice does **not** face that Juri, but someone else from Blue who has a better chance does. Essentially, it’s solving a small assignment problem: who should go first, second, etc., to maximize the overall win chance.

**Example Suggestion:** *“Suggested Order for Team Blue: 1) Alice (Guile), 2) Charlie (Zangief), 3) Bob (Ryu), 4) Diana (Juri), 5) Eve (Cammy). Rationale: Alice’s Guile is a strong opener who has a good matchup against 3 of 5 opponents on Team Red and can potentially eliminate one or two before encountering a bad matchup. Save Diana’s Juri to counter Team Red’s Zangief if he appears (Juri’s mobility gives Zangief trouble). Bob (Ryu) is kept for mid-team flexibility as he has even matchups across the board. Eve (Cammy) is the anchor due to her high-pressure offense which can clutch a win against multiple weakened opponents.”* 

The app’s suggestion might note key pairings: *“If Team Red leads with their Marisa, Alice (Guile) can use her zoning to wear Marisa down ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20play,you%20can%20punish%20using%20Shoryuken)) ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=you%20fight%2C%20bring%20your%20opponent,you%20can%20punish%20using%20Shoryuken)). If they instead send their Juri first, Alice should play cautiously or yield to Bob’s Ryu who has more experience in that matchup.”* In this way, the recommendation is dynamic: it might even present different orders depending on who the opponent is likely to lead with. (The coach can input the known order of the opposing team if they have that info, for a more precise suggestion.)

For **Best-of-Series** format (where each member fights a predetermined opposing member one time ([Team Battle Mode | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Battle_Mode#:~:text=,teams%20of%20two%20or%20four))), the concept of order is less flexible – it’s more about pairing. In that case, the tool can suggest which player should be matched against which opponent for the best outcome. For instance, *“Put your Chun-Li player against their Zangief player (favorable 7-3 matchup in Chun’s favor) and avoid matching your Cammy into their Guile (disadvantageous for Cammy).”* Essentially, it’s an assignment of which player faces whom. The app could output a suggested pairing list for a hypothetical series battle.

*Algorithm details:* Under the hood, this could be a simple greedy algorithm or a more exhaustive search through possible orders. Given at most 5 players a side, trying all permutations (120 possibilities for ordering a team of 5) is feasible. The app can compute a score for each permutation by simulating an elimination battle outcome using estimated win probabilities. The highest scoring order is chosen. If the app has no detailed data, a heuristic approach is to put the strongest player last (anchor) so they definitely get to play, put anyone with a clear counter-matchup to the opponent’s star player in the position to meet them, etc. 

The UI will present the **suggested lineup** for each team (the user’s team and optionally advice for the opponent’s order if the user can influence or predict it). It should be clear that these are suggestions – the coach can always override based on their intimate knowledge of their players (the app might not know, for example, if one player is feeling nervous and should go early rather than anchor).

### Match-up Simulation & Scouting Report

To give a comprehensive scouting report, the app can **simulate the match** between the two teams under various scenarios and summarize the findings. This is like a coach’s game plan: predicting how the matches might flow and what the critical points are.

The simulation would use the team orders (either user-specified or the suggested ones) and step through an elimination match or a series of matches. For each individual fight, the app uses the matchup data to pick a winner. This could be probabilistic (e.g. run the match 1000 times and see win percentages) or a simpler deterministic outcome based on who is favored. The end result could be something like: *“Out of 1000 simulated team battles, Team Blue won 653 (65.3%) – they have a statistical edge given the current matchup lineup.”* This gives the coach a sense of which team is favored. The simulation can also identify swing factors: *“Team Red’s chances improve significantly (to ~45% win rate) if their anchor can defeat at least two opponents. Keeping their anchor till the end is vital.”*

The **Scouting Report** can be presented as a narrative or bullet points highlighting:
- **Key Matchups to Watch:** e.g. *“The duel between Jane (Team Red’s Juri) and Diana (Team Blue’s Cammy) will be pivotal. Juri’s zoning can nullify Cammy’s offense if played perfectly. Our simulations show whoever wins this matchup often ends up leading their team to overall victory.”*
- **Team Momentum:** e.g. *“Team Blue is likely to take an early lead if their Guile wins the first match, as expected. Team Red’s best chance is to have their counterpick (Ken) go early to try and upset Guile.”* This tells the flow of battle.
- **Comeback Factors:** e.g. *“Team Red’s anchor (Zangief) can turn the tables even if they are down, due to Zangief’s explosive damage. However, Team Blue anticipated this by keeping Juri last, who in simulations defeated Zangief 75% of the time thanks to her range ([Street Fighter 6 Ryu guide](https://www.pcgamesn.com/street-fighter-6/ryu#:~:text=Ryu%20launches%20himself%20forward%20with,on%20hit%2C%20putting%20you%20in)).”* Citing that Juri can outrange a grappler backs up the point.
- **Strategy Suggestions:** e.g. *“Coach should ensure Team Blue saves at least one character with a strong anti-grappler strategy for the end, in case Zangief is still in play. Meanwhile, Team Red might rearrange to avoid facing Guile early, perhaps leading with Marisa instead to blow through the zoning before Guile sets the pace.”* These read like coaching tips derived from the data.

The report would be generated in natural language, possibly with some template filled by the simulation results. Even a simpler version could be a **match matrix**: a table of who is likely to beat whom. But a written summary is more user-friendly and matches the style a coach might use in a briefing.

### Coaching Use Case Example

To illustrate, consider a use-case: **Team Blue (coached by you) vs Team Red (opponent)**. You input your Team Blue roster: 
- Alice (Guile, Master rank) 
- Bob (Ken, Diamond) 
- Charlie (Zangief, Platinum) 
- Dana (Juri, Master) 
- Ethan (Ryu, Diamond). 

For the opposing Team Red, you fill in:
- Xander (Marisa, Diamond) 
- Yuki (JP, Master) 
- Wei (Zangief, Diamond) 
- Nina (Kimberly, Platinum) 
- Marco (Ken, Diamond).

After clicking "Analyze", the app produces something like:

**Team Blue Analysis:** Balanced team with strong zoning (Guile, Ryu) and mix-up potential (Ken, Juri). Multiple Master-level players give experience advantage. Potential weakness: only one grappler (Charlie) means if forced into close combat repeatedly, they rely heavily on him.

**Team Red Analysis:** Aggressive team leaning on power (Marisa, Zangief) and unorthodox offense (JP’s traps, Kimberly’s speed). Master experience on JP could be a trump card. However, limited defensive play if put on the back foot (no dedicated zoner). 

**Suggested Order:** Team Blue – 1) Alice (Guile), 2) Charlie (Zangief), 3) Ethan (Ryu), 4) Bob (Ken), 5) Dana (Juri). Team Red – 1) Marco (Ken), 2) Wei (Zangief), 3) Yuki (JP), 4) Nina (Kimberly), 5) Xander (Marisa). 

**Rationale:** Alice’s Guile can handle Marco’s Ken in a battle of attrition (favorable projectile game). If Marco falls, Team Red will likely send Wei’s Zangief; Alice should then cede to Charlie’s Zangief to avoid Guile being caught. The mirror match of Zangiefs might be a grind, but Charlie has slightly better fundamentals (Platinum vs Diamond, but with team support strategy). Yuki’s JP is Team Red’s strongest threat; by placing him third, Team Red aims to break through mid-match – however, Ethan’s solid Ryu can challenge JP by patiently advancing with parries. Finally, Dana’s Juri is saved for last on Team Blue to counter Xander’s Marisa – Juri’s speed and ranged pokes give Marisa problems, as simulations show Dana wins ~70% against Xander in testing. Team Red’s anchor Xander (Marisa) is their damage powerhouse, ideal for cleanup if the match gets to the final members.

**Predicted Outcome:** In simulations, Team Blue won 60% of the time overall. The critical point is match 3 – if Yuki (JP) defeats Ethan (Ryu) quickly without taking too much damage, Team Red’s chances jump significantly, allowing JP to possibly sweep Ken and force the final match. Coach should prepare Ethan with a gameplan specifically for JP’s traps (e.g., use Drive Parry and approach carefully). On the other hand, if Team Blue reaches Dana vs Xander as final match, Dana’s odds to secure the win are high. Team Red might consider swapping Xander (Marisa) earlier if things go south, to avoid leaving a potentially bad matchup for the end ([Team Battle Mode | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Battle_Mode#:~:text=,teams%20of%20two%20or%20four)) (in SF6 Team Battle, the losing team can opt to change order for the next fight ([Team Battle Mode | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Battle_Mode#:~:text=team%20receives%20V,team%20has%20already%20been%20decided)), so Team Red could adjust if they lose early matches).

This example shows how the feature can be used as a virtual coach’s notepad – it ingests the relevant data and outputs actionable insights. It’s tailored to a Team Battle coaching scenario, giving users a template for how to think about team vs team in a fighting game context (something more common in games like KoF or in crew battles, but now present in SF6 as well).

## Integration & Data Sources for Implementation

To build these features on Replit (using Python/Flask for backend and HTML/CSS/JS for frontend), here are some useful APIs, libraries, and data sources:

- **Framework & UI:** Flask can serve the web app, handling form submissions for the team inputs and serving pages for the move guides. Use Jinja2 templates to dynamically inject content (like move data or team analysis results) into the HTML. For a smoother interactive experience, you could incorporate a JavaScript front-end framework (React or Vue), but it’s not strictly necessary. Even without, simple `<script>` can handle showing/hiding video embeds or images on button clicks.
- **Data for Moves:** The move lists and properties can be sourced from official or community databases. The IGN wiki page we referenced has all special move inputs for each character ([Moves List: All Special Moves and Super Arts - Street Fighter 6 Guide - IGN](https://www.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-6/Moves_List:_All_Special_Moves_and_Super_Arts#:~:text=Shoryuken%20Forward%2C%20Down%2C%20Down,moving%20roundhouse%20kick)) ([Moves List: All Special Moves and Super Arts - Street Fighter 6 Guide - IGN](https://www.ign.com/wikis/street-fighter-6/Moves_List:_All_Special_Moves_and_Super_Arts#:~:text=Tatsumaki%20Senpu,roundhouse%20kicks%20performed%20while%20airborne)) – this could be scraped or stored in a JSON for the app. Capcom’s official SF6 command list site is another source (though not an API, it’s HTML). SuperCombo Wiki and Street Fighter Wiki have detailed move info and could be used for text and images (with attribution). No external API is needed here; this is mostly static data that you can compile into your app.
- **Images and Icons:** For controller diagrams, you may use small PNG/SVG icons (like the arrows for directions and fist/foot icons for punches and kicks). StrategyWiki provides a set of **arcade input icons** (directional arrows, punch, kick, etc.) that are 24px images ([Category:Arcade buttons — StrategyWiki | Strategy guide and game reference wiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Category:Arcade_buttons#:~:text=)) ([Category:Arcade buttons — StrategyWiki | Strategy guide and game reference wiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Category:Arcade_buttons#:~:text=)). These can be downloaded and used in the app under fair use for educational purposes. Alternatively, create your own simple icons or use Unicode arrows and circle symbols. For character images or move animations, consider using official art or sprites (Capcom’s website or press kit might have renders) or small GIFs from wikis (the Street Fighter Wiki had GIFs of moves in older games). Ensure image files are optimized for web. In Markdown here we embedded an example quarter-circle icon and a team battle screenshot for illustration; in the actual app, you’d host these images or embed via `<img src>` in HTML with proper path.
- **Video Embeds:** Use YouTube’s embed links or `<iframe>` to show videos of moves. The YouTube API can be used if you want to search videos dynamically. For example, querying “SF6 Ryu Tatsumaki tutorial” could get you a relevant video to embed. However, a curated approach might be safer (to avoid unpredictable content). You can also include a video player for local videos or GIFs if you have permission to use them.
- **Matchup Data & Stats:** This part can leverage external data: 
  - Capcom’s **Buckler’s Boot Camp** (the SF6 online portal) for player stats and character usage charts ([Battle Diagrams | Buckler's Boot Camp | STREET FIGHTER 6](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/en/stats/dia#:~:text=Battle%20Diagrams%20,league%20of%20Street%20Fighter%206)) ([Buckler's Boot Camp | STREET FIGHTER 6 | CAPCOM](https://www.streetfighter.com/6/buckler/en#:~:text=Buckler%27s%20Boot%20Camp%20,other%20data%20from%20the%20game)). There is no public API, but community-driven scrapers exist. For example, an **Apify Street Fighter 6 CFN Scraper** can fetch data like rank distributions ([Street Fighter 6 CFN Scraper - Apify](https://apify.com/3ternal/street-fighter-6-cfn-scraper#:~:text=Street%20Fighter%206%20CFN%20Scraper,of%20players%20in%20each%20rank)). If you wanted to get a particular player’s profile (win rates with each character, etc.), you might automate a login and fetch from the boot camp site, though that’s advanced. 
  - **Community APIs/Projects:** Some GitHub projects like `andrewzah/sf6-api` are working on exposing CFN stats via an API ([andrewzah/sf6-api - GitHub](https://github.com/andrewzah/sf6-api#:~:text=andrewzah%2Fsf6,the%20api%20is%20very%20unstable)). These could become useful to directly query player data by CFN ID. Additionally, the **Toornament API** ([Street Fighter 6 | API v2.0 | Toornament Developer](https://developer.toornament.com/v2/core-concepts/discipline/features/streetfighter6#:~:text=Street%20Fighter%206%20,specifically%20for%20Street%20Fighter%206)) can provide info on tournament results; if the teams are part of a tournament, you might pull their past meeting results.
  - **Matchup Charts:** You might manually encode a matchup chart for all characters (perhaps using community tier list data). For instance, a  -1/0/+1 style matrix indicating which character has advantage. This can feed the win probability estimates in the simulation. This data could be sourced from forums or expert opinions until more empirical data is available.
  - **Machine Learning (optional):** If you gather enough data (say from many recorded matches), you could train a simple model to predict outcomes (this is likely overkill here, but an interesting extension). Otherwise, sticking to rule-based logic and known stats is sufficient.
- **Libraries for Analysis:** Use Python libraries like **pandas** to organize input data (e.g. put the team info in DataFrames) and perform any calculations (averages, etc.). For the simulation, a straightforward Python script is fine. If doing many iterations, libraries like `random` for Monte Carlo simulation or even `itertools` for permutation testing will help. If you want to solve an assignment problem for best matchups, you could use `itertools.permutations` or apply an algorithm like the Hungarian algorithm (via `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` if you formulate it as a cost minimization problem).
- **Display & Charts:** To present analysis results, you might include charts or graphs (for instance, a bar chart comparing team win rates, or a simple chart showing cumulative win probability as each match in the series progresses). A JavaScript chart library like **Chart.js** could render on the front-end after receiving data from Flask (perhaps via an AJAX call that returns JSON of simulation results). Even without charts, formatting the output with clear headings (as we did in this document) and maybe using colored text or icons (like green up arrows for strengths, red down arrows for weaknesses) can add visual clarity.
- **Testing & Iteration:** Because this tool deals with predictive suggestions, it would be good to allow the user to tweak assumptions. For example, a slider to adjust how much weight to give player rank vs character advantage in the prediction. This can be done in the UI and fed back into the simulation.

By integrating these elements, the Replit app will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for both practicing move inputs and devising team strategies. It combines static data (move commands, images, videos) with dynamic computation (team matchup analysis) to create an interactive coaching toolkit. With proper structure (as outlined above) and the use of reliable data sources ([Tatsumaki | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Tatsumaki#:~:text=The%20practitioner%20jumps%20and%2C%20while,Spark%20%20and%20%20124)) ([Team Battle Mode | Street Fighter Wiki | Fandom](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Battle_Mode#:~:text=,teams%20of%20two%20or%20four)), the app will not only be informative but also engaging for Street Fighter 6 players looking to up their game.
